# Devjobs web app

## Overview
Build a jobs board that pulls data from a local JSON file.

This is a solution to the [Devjobs web app challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/devjobs-web-app-HuvC_LP4l). Frontend Mentor challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects.
### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Be able to filter jobs on the index page by title, location, and whether a job is for a full-time position
- Have the correct color scheme chosen for them based on their computer preferences.
